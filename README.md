Context:
Short Message Service (SMS) messages are short messages sent from one person to another from their mobile phones. They represent a means of personal communication that is an important communicative artifact in our current digital era.

This dataset contains two SMS messages in two languages: Singapore English and Mandarin Chinese.

Content:
This is a corpus of SMS (Short Message Service) messages collected for research at the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. This dataset consists of 67,093 SMS messages taken from the corpus on Mar 9, 2015. The messages largely originate from Singaporeans and mostly from students attending the University. These messages were collected from volunteers who were made aware that their contributions were going to be made publicly available. The data collectors opportunistically collected as much metadata about the messages and their senders as possible, so as to enable different types of analyses.
